SAMD51G19A_trellis_04_Nov_2018_aa.atzip

As usual, the project that started with the above
atzip file comes from Atmel Start with no frequency
specified for the clocks:

 $ cat ../boards/trellis_m4_usb/config/peripheral_clk_config.h | egrep FREQ | egrep define

#define CONF_CPU_FREQUENCY 48000000
#define CONF_GCLK_USB_FREQUENCY 48000000

These were set to '0' (zero!) by AtmelStart.

This is likely due to:

 $ cat ../boards/trellis_m4_usb/config/hpl_oscctrl_config.h | egrep Closed
// <1=>Closed Loop Mode

Which is enacted by:

#define CONF_DFLL_MODE 0x1

Closed loop mode is not the default; it was selected
for this project based on code found on the Internet
(probably the code published by Jake Read).
