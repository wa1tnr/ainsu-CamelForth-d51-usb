The ainsu-CamelForth-d51-usb version (singleton,
single target, no 'boards' directory) got all
the upgrades for dot S (.S) foo.

It's one or two days ahead of the -CF version.
aka ainsu-CF_USB_CDC/boards/metro_m4_usb.

This (CamelForth proper) has none of that, and
so must be migrated to one of the other two
(just mentioned, above) for local development
(ainsu branding used for those variations).
