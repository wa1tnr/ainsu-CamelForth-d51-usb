The following function cuts a given range out of a char buffer.
The range is identified by startng index and length. A negative
length may be specified to indicate the range from the starting
index to the end of the string.

/*
 *      Remove given section from string. Negative len means
 *      remove everything up to the end.
 */
int str_cut(char *str, int begin, int len)
{
    int l = strlen(str);

    if (len < 0) len = l - begin;
    if (begin + len > l) len = l - begin;
    memmove(str + begin, str + begin + len, l - len + 1);

    return len;
}

The char range is cut out by moving everything after the
range including the terminating '\0' to the starting index
with memmove, thereby overwriting the range. The text in
the range is lost.

Note that you need to pass a char buffer whose contents
can be changed. Don't pass string literals that are stored
in read-only memory.
